# EhrlichPOS_BE


This is a simple exercise given by Ehrlich in which I need to create an endpoint based on the sample data that is given.

Approach made was the database first approach, in which I imported the sample data in the database and created their corresponding relation (PK, FK) and set the Identity. After these, I perform the Scaffold-DbContext to create the necessary model in the VS Studio.

### Technology Used:
* .NET & Entity Framework
* MS SQL Server

### Note:
Project Repository has 2 branches.
* Main Branch
* Dev Branch (based on Main Branch)
